        		<h1>John's Linux One-Liners Depot</h1>
				<p>Over the many years as a System Admin I've managed to complete various tasks utilizing one-liners. Although I'm proficient in various scripting languanges, sometimes I find that just whipping up a quick one-liner to accomplish the task is just much faster and sometimes more challenging. Who wants easy right? Anyway, this depot as I'm calling it will be filled with the various one-liners that I've come up with over the years and continue to do so to this day. It's my hope that others may find them useful to accomplish various tasks. Enjoy!</p>
